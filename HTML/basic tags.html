        ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is 
        commonly associated with children, but many continue to experience 
        its symptoms into adulthood. For adults, the condition often manifests 
        as restlessness, constant fidgeting, impulsivity, difficulty focusing, or 
        challenges with organization. While it can sometimes be misunderstood as
         inattentiveness or nervous energy, ADHD is a recognised neurodevelopmental disorder.

        Full Text of the Poem
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
      </p>
